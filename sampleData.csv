"Me and my couple of friends had a chance to stay at this hotel. The room was extremely huge with a great arial view of the Goan capital. This hotel is in one of plush locality and highly recommended to hire a self rental vehicle or own car since the hotel is interior from main road. Overall had a great experience and would surely visit this place in future.  All those visit Goa just to visit casino, then this place is threat choice due its proximity to the casinos.",EXCELLENT,Jai_44,Mangalore, December 2019,Travelled with friends,@Home B&B DonaPaula,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The location of this accommodation is ideal for travelers looking for peace and quiet, a bit further away from the hustle and bustle of the city and the surrounding area. Athome B & B Donapaula is located at the end of an access road and in a quiet residential area, so there is almost no traffic. In addition, for walkers the nearest central stop ""DonaPaula"" for buses in about 30 minutes on foot easily accessible and continue in about 10 minutes the famous DonaPaula Viewpoint. My recommendation to travelers in this accommodation: Book without breakfast option ... if the breakfast buffet is then offered, it can be booked in the accommodation. And the people there are friendly and helpful.",,afr1970,"Graz, Austria", November 2019,,@Home B&B DonaPaula,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Firstly, i am a travel freak, like to travel places. When i reached with my family to @home B&B, there was no one at the reception. We waited for 30 mins when called the person who took booking, she was not picking the home. After 30 mins a guy appeared and told us there's no electricity. We have to use 1 fan and 1 light. He didnt knew if i had booked my room. Secondly, as we reached by 3 pm in the afternoon we were hungry but the food takes 50 mins as it need to be brought from some remote place. Finally when tried to call them for food the phone is not working.  Not the place to leave in there.",POOR,Maps229167,NULL, December 2018,Travelled with family,@Home B&B DonaPaula,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just loved the room. The rooms are so spacious and clean. Even the bathrooms are so clean and tidy. I happened to stay here for a night and i was absolutely delighted by the stay. The breakfast is pretty okay though. Wish it had more variety. Google maps is quite a necessity as it is located in the interiors. The view from the rooms is fabulous.,,Nikitapanchal12,"Mumbai, India", August 2018,Travelled with family,@Home B&B DonaPaula,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Very good hotel at the given price. Nice, clean and spacious rooms. We booked two family rooms for 3days with beautiful balcony view.  Toilets were neat and Clean.Breakfast is also delicious with limited menu.   Ambience and service offered by all three guys ,specially Merwin in the eve & night,  bcoz day time we were out. They responds to even a single call,even arranged our all tours. Although place is bit interior, as no shops and restaurants are  near by, but food can be ordered from restaurant.Comportable and peaceful place to stay with family.",VERY GOOD,Anil T,"Mumbai, India", August 2017,Travelled solo,@Home B&B DonaPaula,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We arrived early in the morning after a night spent on the train. Even though check in wasn´t until 1pm, they got us into our room by 10:30am. Before that, they let us freshen up in the communal bathroom. The room is extremely spacious with lots of square footage. The view is also quite nice. You have everything you need and more with a very generous and clean bathroom as well. The breakfast was also good with a selection of continental and Indian breakfast items. We also ordered dinner here one night and it was nice meal...not highly-recommended but adequate. The biggest drawback for us was the location. We felt very isolated up on the big hill and there wasn´t really anything was great interest close by. Whether you want to stay at this place or not depends very much on what",VERY GOOD,SMETravels,"Stuttgart, Germany", December 2017,,@Home B&B DonaPaula,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I was there in March'17 for my marriage anniversary and it was worth staying there. Initially I booked for 2 days only, thought we'll change the hotel on 3rd day. But guess what, I again booked this place as an extension - now you can imagine how amazing it is. The scenic view from you room is itself a 'paisa-wasool'. Additionally the breakfast was good and you will get a handful of choices for your morning breakfast. I didn't try any meal. Staffs are humble and helpful. You will find a great peace and satisfaction.    The only -ve point is travelling to this place if you don't have your own vehicle. Fortunately I had my car and I enjoyed thoroughly.",EXCELLENT,Gaurav S,NULL, March 2017,,@Home B&B DonaPaula,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We stayed at @B&B for 5 days ; Accommodation was clean , Spacious and quite. Breakfast is fantastic.  Facility offers free drop to nearby locations - which is a great plus as the location - Nagali hills is secluded.  Manager is very helpful and assisted us with various needs. (Mr. Laksman - thank you. )  We preferred to have food outside , except Breakfast of course.  This property is highly recommended , if you want to get away to a peaceful quite location.",EXCELLENT,Marsha S,Dubai, July 2017,,@Home B&B DonaPaula,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Home B & B is nice place for the stay in Goa but you should have your own vehicle in this place. Staff is very good and cooperative, Service was excellent, it is near to Hone Paula city, room are neat and clean, service was excellent..",POOR,Sanjay M,NULL, May 2017,,@Home B&B DonaPaula,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
